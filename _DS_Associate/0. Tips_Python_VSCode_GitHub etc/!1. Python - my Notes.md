# Relative Path Issues:

- Jupyter Notebook adjusts the working directory to the notebookâ€™s location.
- .py files rely on the current working directory (CWD) where the script is executed, which can lead to mismatches.
Dynamic Paths:
- Using os.path.dirname(__file__) ensures the script locates files relative to its own directory, making it portable and robust.
- Best Practice:
Always use dynamic paths for file access in Python projects to avoid dependency on the working directory.
```py
import os
df = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'data', 'airlines_final.csv'))
```
for relative path like 
"_DS_Associate\20. Cleaning Data in Python\data"
and path: 
"C:\github\DataCamp\_DS_Associate\20. Cleaning Data in Python"
